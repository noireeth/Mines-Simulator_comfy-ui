# Stake.com-Mines-simulator V.comfy
A game inspired by Stake.com Mines. Small side project, feel free to give me suggestions and add my discord: @qex404      to help me keep adding more stuff

Here are some improvements that I'm currently working on

- Sounds to add: 
				rare.mp3
				achievement_banner.mp3
  
 - Fix diamond sound so it sounds different
   
   â†³ Now all local sounds stopped working, still working on this
   
 - Add favicon and custom tab name
 - Fix the gap with the tiles
 - Better Lofi songs, that are random
 - The new formula for the multipliers: for each extra bomb in the game, starting from x1.1 (for one bomb), you +0.3 to the multiplier.
   Then for each tile uncovered in the round it's (number of tiles clicked) x 0.1 (that goes up by x0.1 for every extra tile clicked).
 - Add a simple global chat at the bottom
